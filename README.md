### README.md Generator
    
### DESCRIPTION

How could I easily finish assignments without writing a README from scratch every time?
I can create a read me generator to save myself time on homework/future job assignments.
This will allow me to end my assignments with ease and have a leisurely night
This helped me learn how to use inquirer through node.js
    
### INSTALLATION

to run this project, you need to open up my README-Generator file. After doing so you can open the terminal in vs code. Then you can run 'node index.js' in the terminal and follow the questions prompted.
